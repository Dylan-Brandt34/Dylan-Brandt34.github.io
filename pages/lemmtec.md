# Lemmtec #

## Introduction ## 

I began work at Lemmtec in the summer of 2020 and have been fortunate enough to have worked there for the last year and half. Lemmtec is primarily a company that builds websites for: small businesses, churches, and other organizations. However, websites have not been the only thing I have worked on for Lemmtec. In addition to websites, I have worked on a web application for my boss that utilizes a react js front end, and a C# with ASP.net and SQL server database on the backend. 

## Websites ## 
Websites I have worked on range from using very few tools, such as HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, to more advanced sites that utilize wordpress themes and plugins. 

## Web Application ## 
Working on the web application, I have learned many useful skills. The last 6 months or so, I have worked mostly on the web application with few website tasks inbetween.

### **IDE Experience** ###
When working on the backend of my code, I use the **Visual Studio** IDE to program in **C#**. Although this was my primary IDE of use through out my college career, I have become much more accustomed and efficient by working under Lemmtec. It is through visual studio that I write most of my SQL querries, but I am familiar with the SQL Server Management Studio IDE for viewing and editing tables. 

When developing code for the frontend, I use **Visual Studio Code** to write in **React.js**. Prior to working for Lemmtec, I had very little experience with using VSCode but have now become very fimiliar with the development environment. 

### **Backend Development** ### 
Backend development is almost exclusively involved around creating restful api's in C#. These api's are used for retrieving, editing, and creating objects to be made onto the sql database.

I have provided an example above of the **Project** table on the sql database as well as the project data type in the C# code. ASP.NET is used to execute SQL querries that accomplish the objectives of the api's. (Shown Below)

The API's are set up to be called from the react code on the frontend. Depending on what sort of task is being exectuted, decides what api is being called. These calls can range from being used to retrieve lists of information of the database to just retriving a single item. 

### **Frontend Development** ### 
The front end is built with **React.js** and is responsible for all of the visualization seen on the webpage (along with the help of CSS and HTML ofcourse). Because of javascript, the webpage can avoid reloading upon navigating through the different webpage. Each webpage utilizes the api's on the backend inorder to retrieve the data the webpage needs to be displayed.

# Portfolio About

## Introduction

My name is **Dylan Brandt** and this is my portfolio built to display my past and current achievements and experiences. This will give you easy access to see my development skills and experiences. 

## Education 

### Motlow State Community College
I began work on my undergraduate degree at ==Motlow State Community College== in fall of 2018. While attending Motlow, I became accustomed to the C++ programming language and also was given some experience with the MASM assembly language. It was here that I became exposed to more advanced programming concepts, such as pointers and Object Oriented Programming. I completed my associates degree in spring of 2020. 

### University of Alabama (Huntsville)
Once I acquired my associates degree, I transferred to ==University of Alabama in Hunstville== (UAH) in the fall of 2020. While attending UAH I became accustomed to : 

- Object Oriented Programming (More in-depth than that of Motlow)
- OpenGl (2D and 3D vector graphics utilizing C++)
- ARM assembly language (used on a rasberry pi)
- Unity game engine with C#
- OOP Java 

I finished **Bachelors Degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics** in spring of 2022.

## Employment

It was at **UAH** that I had the opportunity to work on a few different group projects. This helped me realize the importance of programming as a team. I also became exposed to using github for version control within our projects. Just before the fall semester of my senior year, I began intern work at **Lemmtec**. This has been invaluable towards my knowledge of web applications. Under the employment of Lemmtec, I've had experience with: 
- **Web Application** 
- *C#*
- *asp.net framework* 
- *javascript with react framework* 
- **Wordpress** 
- *Html*
- *Css* 
- *PHP*

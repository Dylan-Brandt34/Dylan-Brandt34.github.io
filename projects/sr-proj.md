# Patient Management Software # 

## Introduction ## 

During my final semester at UAH before finishing my bachelor's degree, I took a senior design class. This class put me and 3 of my other peers together to create a large program. The program we were tasked with creating was a *patient management software*. This tool was to simulate something a hospital might use inorder to keep the information regarding patients secure yet accessible by the hostpital staff. 

## Tools and Methodologies ##

My team and I were very careful in the early stages of our planning to make sure that we kept an open mind as to what tools would best fit our project. The first thing we decided on together was that we knew we wanted to expose our selves to the *agile* methodology. This involved weekly sprints and goals (scrum), as well as daily stand-up meetings throughout the school week. We also made sure to talk together at the beginning of every week to breakdown our requirements into achievable goals that we could complete throughout the week. 

### Backend ###
Due to the object-oriented nature of Java we decided that this should be the backend of our software. Along side Java, we used a no-SQL database due to alot unknowns in the structure of our project. We decided to use Mongo-db due to its ease of use with java. 

### Frontend ### 
*Java Swing* was what we decided to use for the front end of our application.
